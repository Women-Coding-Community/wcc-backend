## Find something to work on

The first step to start contributing is to find something to work on.
Help is always welcome, and no contribution is too small!

Please browse the current
open [issues](https://github.com/Women-Coding-Community/wcc-backend/issues).

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.

## Best practices

- Write clear and meaningful git commit messages.
- If the PR will *completely* fix a specific issue, include `fixes #123` in the PR body (where 123
  is the specific issue number the PR will fix. This will automatically close the issue when the PR
  is merged.
- Make sure you don't include `@mentions` or `fixes` keywords in your git commit messages. These
  should be included in the PR body instead.
- When you make a PR for small change (such as fixing a typo, style change, or grammar fix), please
  squash your commits so that we can maintain a cleaner git history.
- Make sure you include a clear and detailed PR description explaining the reasons for the changes,
  and ensuring there is sufficient information for the reviewer to understand your PR.
