I entered this program because I felt isolated since I seemed to not have any clarity of my career and had a sense of general \"directionless\". Mentor has made me feel validated in my feeling and has helped me understand that my anxiety stems from not having a good understanding of the industry I hope to be a part of. Through our sessions and an exercise she gave me, I was gained a better perceptive on how exactly to direct my focus.",
