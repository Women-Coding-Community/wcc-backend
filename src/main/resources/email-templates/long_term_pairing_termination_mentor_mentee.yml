    <p>Dear {{mentorFirstName}} and {{menteeFirstName}},</p>
  
    <p>
    We are writing to formally conclude the mentoring match between you for the {{year}} cycle 
    of WCC's Long-term Mentoring Programme.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    While it is unfortunate that this match has not worked out as hoped, we would like 
    to reiterate our thanks to both of you for your time and engagement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We hope to support you in future cycles in ways that are more conducive to your needs and availability.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If you have any questions or would like to stay involved in other programme activities 
    we have within the community, please feel free to reach out.
