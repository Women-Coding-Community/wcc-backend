    <p>Hi {{menteeFirstName}},</p>

    <p>
    Thank you for sharing your feedback about the Ad-hoc mentoring programme.  
    We are sorry {{feedbackFromMentee}} the scheduled session with {{mentorFullName}} did not happen as expected.

    <p>
    This does not align with how the programme is typically run as per our Mentorship Code of Conduct,  
    and we will be taking measures to properly address the situation.

    </p>

    <p>
    Once again, we apologise that this experience was not as you expected and we hope 
    you would still be interested in attending a session with our other mentors.
    </p>

    <p>
    Thank you for your time.
    </p>
