    <p>Dear {{mentorName}} and {{menteeName}},</p>

    <p>
    We are excited to introduce you to our <strong>Mentorship Programme</strong>!
    </p>

    <p><strong>Contact information:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mentor:</strong> {{mentorName}} (<a href="mailto:{{mentorEmail}}">{{mentorEmail}}</a>)</li>
      <li><strong>Mentee:</strong> {{menteeName}} (<a href="mailto:{{menteeEmail}}">{{menteeEmail}}</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    We believe that mentorship is a powerful tool for personal and professional growth, and we are thrilled to have you as part of this program.
    We hope that this mentorship relationship will be a valuable opportunity for you to learn, grow, and achieve your goals.
    </p>

    <p>
    The mentorship program will run from <strong>April to September</strong>.
    The frequency and format of the meetings will be decided by you during your initial meeting.
    We recommend at least <strong>two mentoring sessions per month</strong> (45 minutes to 1 hour each) to ensure a meaningful relationship.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Getting started:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Schedule an initial meeting to discuss expectations.
        The mentee is kindly asked to book the first session using the mentor’s scheduling link:
        <a href="{{mentorSchedulingLink}}">Schedule your first meeting</a>
      </li>
      <li>Define specific and measurable goals for the mentorship relationship.</li>
      <li>Develop an action plan to achieve those goals.</li>
      <li>Schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress and adjust the action plan as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    We also encourage both of you to communicate regularly outside of scheduled mentorship sessions
    (using your preferred channel: Slack or email) to get the most out of the program.
