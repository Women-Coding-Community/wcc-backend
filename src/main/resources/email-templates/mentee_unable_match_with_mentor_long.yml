    <p>Dear {{menteeNames}},</p>

    <p>
    Thank you so much for your interest in the <strong>Women Coding Community Mentorship Programme</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    At this time, we haven’t been able to match you with a mentor from your selected list.
    We understand how important mentorship is, and we share your disappointment that we were not able to find a mentor for you.
    </p>

    <p>
    While we weren’t able to match you with any of the mentors you selected for the long-term mentorship cycle at this stage,
    we want to assure you that your journey with us is just beginning.
    Your profile will remain on our waiting list, and if a mentor becomes available or a spot opens up,
    we’ll reach out to you right away.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the meantime, we’re excited to share that we’re launching <strong>study groups</strong> by the end of this week to support more mentees!
    These groups will be a great way to connect with others, learn together, and grow your skills while staying active in our community.
    </p>

    <p>
    More details on study groups and how to apply will be announced soon — stay tuned!
    </p>

    <p>
    We also encourage you to consider applying for <strong>one-time (ad-hoc) mentoring sessions</strong> via our website.
    This option will allow you to connect with mentors who have expertise in your field.
    Please note that applications for one-time mentoring sessions open at the beginning of each month,
    and you can apply during the <strong>first 10 days of each month</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
    We appreciate your patience and understanding, and we look forward to connecting you with a mentor soon.
    </p>
