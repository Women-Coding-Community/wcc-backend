    <p>Dear Mentor,</p>
  
    <p>
    As we approach the end of the program for {{year}}, we wanted to extend our heartfelt gratitude for the time, 
    guidance, and dedication you have shared with your mentees.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To recognise and celebrate your efforts, we will be presenting recognition certificates to our active mentors.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Please take a moment to remind your long-term mentees (if any) to log all sessions in the attendance tracker.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Please encourage your mentee to provide feedback for you so we can showcase it on your profile, 
    highlighting your impact and strengthening your presence on our website.
