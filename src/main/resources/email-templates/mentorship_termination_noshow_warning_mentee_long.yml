    <p>Hi {{menteeName}},</p>
  
    <p>
    We are reaching out regarding your current status within the Women Coding Community
    MentorshipProgramme.<br/>
    We have noticed that you have not engaged with your assigned mentor nor logged any sessions
    in the {{WCCMentorshipAttendanceTracker2025Link}} since the start of the programme.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This lack of engagement is a serious concern, as consistent communication and active participation
    are essential to a meaningful mentorship experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As per the Women Coding Community's Mentee Code of Conduct, we would like to remind you of the following:
    </p>
    
    <p>
    No-shows are unacceptable for both mentors and mentees. Participants who fail to attend sessions
    without notice may be excluded from the current and future mentorship programme cycles.<br/>
    No-replies by email or Slack for more than a week are unacceptable during the programme.
    Participants who applied but fail to respond without reason will be banned from the current cycle.<br/>
    It is expected that mentees maintain timely communication and engage proactively with their mentors.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To continue in the programme, you must respond to this email by {{deadline}}, confirming whether
    you wish to remain an active mentee. If we do not hear from you by then, your mentorship will be
    officially terminated for this cycle.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If there are challenges preventing your participation, please let us know so we can try to support you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Please acknowledge receipt of this email and share your decision by the deadline above.
    </p>
