---

#### 8. Mentorship Matching System

**Status**: BACKEND 70% | FRONTEND 55% 🚧

**Implemented**:

- ✅ Mentee registration creates a profile with `profileStatus = PENDING`
- ✅ Mentee application storage with priority order
- ✅ Mentorship Team pending-mentee queue: `GET /api/platform/v1/mentees/pending`
- ✅ Mentee profile activation: `PATCH /api/platform/v1/mentees/{menteeId}/activate`
- ✅ Mentee profile rejection: `PATCH /api/platform/v1/mentees/{menteeId}/reject`
- ✅ Mentor application review endpoints
- ✅ Admin application approval workflow moves applications to `MENTOR_REVIEWING`
- ✅ Mentor dashboard can accept or decline reviewed applications
- ✅ Match confirmation endpoint and match tracking
- ✅ Admin mentee review page in `admin-wcc-app`
- ✅ Mentor application dashboard in `admin-wcc-app`

**Current workflow split**:

**1. Mentee Profile Review** ✅:

- Mentee submits mentorship registration
- Profile is created with `profileStatus = PENDING`
- Mentorship Team can activate or reject the mentee profile
- Profile approval is separate from individual application approval

**2. Mentee Application Review** ✅:

- Applications are stored with `status = PENDING`
- Mentorship Team approves or rejects each application individually
- Approved applications move to `MENTOR_REVIEWING`
- Rejected applications move to `REJECTED`

**3. Mentor Decision Flow** ✅:

- Mentors fetch their assigned applications
- Mentors accept or decline applications in review
- Accepted applications can later be confirmed into matches
- Declined applications can be forwarded through the priority flow

**4. Matching Confirmation** 🚧:

- Match creation and tracking are implemented
- Session lifecycle admin endpoints exist
- Notification and end-to-end automation still need completion in some areas

**Current APIs**:

```
POST /api/platform/v1/mentees                                  - Create mentee registration/profile
GET /api/platform/v1/mentees/pending                           - List pending mentee profiles
PATCH /api/platform/v1/mentees/{menteeId}/activate             - Activate mentee profile
PATCH /api/platform/v1/mentees/{menteeId}/reject               - Reject mentee profile
PATCH /api/platform/v1/mentees/applications/{applicationId}/approve - Approve individual application
PATCH /api/platform/v1/mentees/applications/{applicationId}/reject  - Reject individual application
GET /api/platform/v1/mentors/{mentorId}/applications           - View mentee applications for mentor
PATCH /api/platform/v1/mentors/applications/{applicationId}/accept  - Mentor accepts application
PATCH /api/platform/v1/mentors/applications/{applicationId}/decline - Mentor declines application
POST /api/platform/v1/admin/mentorship/matches/confirm/{applicationId} - Confirm match
```

**Still missing / incomplete for MVP**:

- 🚧 Matching suggestion API
- 🚧 Full mentee-facing application status dashboard
- 🚧 Complete notification flow for every mentee review transition
- 🚧 Documentation and integration tests aligned to the latest profile-vs-application split

**Priority**: CRITICAL - This remains the core value proposition of the MVP
