### Description

Provide description of a new feature. Include:

- How it should work/what problem it solves
- Any specific requirements or edge cases.
- Mockups or examples, if applicable.

<!-- Example:
Create Members GET API to retrieve a list of members from the file (database) repository.
GET API does not modify data. It will also handle GET API Response Codes:

- HTTP response code 200 (OK)
- HTTP response code 404 (NOT FOUND)
- HTTP response code 400 (BAD REQUEST)

GET API will return all member's data from the repository -->

### Expected behavior

Describe the expected behavior.

<!-- Example:  When Client use GET to access members resources that are located at the specified URL on
the server, the server will respond with the list of members and all its data. -->

### Possible solution

Describe possible solution.

<!-- Example: Use the Controller-Service-Repository pattern from Spring Boot applications. The
Controller is responsible for exposing the GET functionality to the client. The Repository is
responsible for storing and retrieving members data. The Service gets the request from the
Controller and use Repository functions to get data from the database. -->

### Additional Context

Include any other context, logs, or screenshots that might help explain your request.

<!-- 
For example: 
- Enhanced feature designs Screenshot
- API structure
- Schema
